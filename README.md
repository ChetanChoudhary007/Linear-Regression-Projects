# Linear Regression Projects

Welcome to the Linear Regression Projects repository! This repository contains two separate projects: **House Price Prediction** and **Car Price Prediction**. Each project focuses on developing a machine learning model using linear regression to predict prices based on various features and attributes. This README.md file will guide you through the structure, usage, and getting started with both projects.

## Project Overview

### House Price Prediction Project

The goal of the House Price Prediction project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices based on features like location, size, and other relevant attributes. This project can provide valuable insights to buyers and sellers in the real estate market.

### Car Price Prediction Project

The Car Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of cars using attributes like make, model, year, and mileage. This can be useful for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Installation

To get started with either project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ChetanChoudhary007/linear-regression-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```
   cd linear-regression-projects
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Once you have set up the environment, you can start using the projects. Here's how:

1. Prepare your data:
   - Place the necessary dataset CSV files in the appropriate locations for each project (e.g., `/house-price-prediction/data.csv` and `/car-price-prediction/car_data.csv`).

2. Run the data processing and model training scripts for each project:
   ```
   house_price_prediction.ipynb
   car_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. The scripts will load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Model Training

Both projects involve training predictive models using linear regression. The scripts (`house_price_prediction.ipynb` and `car_price_prediction.ipynb`) handle data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for their respective projects.

## Evaluation

The evaluation of each model's performance is done using relevant metrics such as R-squared score and other appropriate metrics. Visualizations are also included to aid in understanding the relationships between predicted and actual prices.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve these projects are welcome! If you encounter issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
